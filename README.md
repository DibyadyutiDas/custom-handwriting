# ✍️ Text-to-Handwriting Converter

## Overview
Welcome to the **AI-powered Text-to-Handwriting Converter**! This project allows you to transform plain text into a beautifully crafted handwritten-style image. We are currently building the core functionality and refining the AI model, with plans for a future web release!

| This AI-powered service takes input text and converts it into your personalized handwriting style. Powered by **Node.js** on the backend, it uses advanced AI techniques to generate realistic handwritten text. A simple API is available for integration with other services. | ![Handwriting Example](https://github.com/DibyadyutiDas/portfolio/blob/main/text-handwriting_converter.png) |
